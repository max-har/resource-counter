# resource-counter

The programme scrapes data from URLs and returns count values of list items in an XSLX file.

More specifically, `resource-counter.py` counts the resources on the Vikalp Sangam website (URL: https://vikalpsangam.org/) and outputs the results in a spreadsheet (with 11 resource categories in the columnns and 8 resource types in the rows, plus a column and a row for the totals).

In addition, `resource-counter.py` illustrates the results by outputting a bar chart and two pie charts (one for resource categories and one for resource types).

The programme was written during an internship with Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group in Pune India in 2019.
